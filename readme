The purpose of this utility is to organize files (primarily images and videos) into a yyyy\mm based hierarchy.  It will first attempt to get EXIF based timestamps but fall back to filesystem timestamps to move the file into the appropriate directory. I've found it useful for merging files from two different sources (grandma's camera, my iphone, etc...).

The resulting directory structure will look something like this:
2002
	01
	02
	03
	04
	...
2003
	01
	02
	03
	...


Usage:
	Command line format is: photoreorganizer.py startDir [destDir]
	Example: photoreorganizer.py "C:\Documents and Settings\chriss\My Documents\My Pictures" "C:\MyNewPhotosDir"
	Leaving the second parameter blank will simply create the dest directories as sub directories of the start dir (a very common use case)
